# Vehicle Marketplace Scraping Service

A web application for scraping vehicle listings from dealer websites.

## Database Setup

This application uses Supabase as a backend. To set up the database:

1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Set up the environment variables in `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   ```
3. Run the migration scripts in the `migrations` folder using the Supabase SQL editor:
   - `01_create_dealers_table.sql` - Creates the dealers table

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
